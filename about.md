## About 

Fitness is part of my everyday life. I learn from it, teach from it and overall live by it. I love good people, good energy, positivity and optimisim.
Strong-willed, focused and sincerely want the best for everyone around me.

## How

With specific trainings at different stages of my life, I have my workouts mains distributed throughout the weekdays and spend more time with my hobbies and 
loved ones on weekends.
You may ask, how is it not boring after doing it for over ten years straight; that is because I make sure to surround myself with wonderful people with similar
goals and have lots of fun with every workout.
The gym can surely be a fun place. It is a world away from the world.

## What I do

I work as a fitness trainer/ Online fitness coach, lifecoach, fitness models alongside other business interests.
